**Cinna** is a composable infrastructure for intelligent agents.  
A semantic mesh where AI modules are interoperable, memory is wallet-bound, and the protocol is open.

This is not AI as a product.  
This is AI as a protocol.

## Why Cinna?

🧠 **Modular Agents**  
Cinna agents are specialized and designed to work together.  
They are not apps — they are building blocks of distributed cognition.

📡 **MCP Powered**  
Everything speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://humanloop.com/blog/mcp).  
Agents and tools connect dynamically through shared context.

🧬 **Semantic Identity**  
Every agent and tool can be registered onchain with the OSS Registry.  
This enables permissionless discovery and composability.

🔐 **Self-Sovereign Memory**  
Encrypted, wallet-bound memory ensures your history belongs to you.  
Context persists across agents without any central storage.

## What You Can Build

- AI pipelines using Firecrawl, CoinGecko, Bitquery, and Exa  
- Modular research agents with persistent encrypted memory  
- Custom autonomous assistants that act across Web2 and Web3  
- Meta-agents that reason about other tools in real time

Agents in Cinna are designed to cooperate and evolve.  
This is intelligence in motion.
