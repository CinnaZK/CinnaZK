# Cinna

**Cinna** is a decentralized infrastructure for composable, privacy-preserving AI agents. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Cinna enables intelligent systems to collaborate, reason, and evolve across a shared semantic and computational layer.

Cinna introduces a new class of agent-to-agent interactions through modularity, interoperability, and user-owned memory. It brings Web3 principles to the AI stack, allowing developers to build and compose intelligent agents with fine-grained control over data, tools, and execution.

## ✨ Key Concepts

- **Composable Intelligence**: Agents designed as modular, task-specific components that can be combined to solve complex problems
- **MCP Integration**: A standardized protocol for agent and tool communication, enabling dynamic workflows
- **Agent Mesh**: A decentralized network of AI agents discoverable and interoperable across Web2 and Web3 services
- **OSS (Semantic Symbol)**: A decentralized identity system for registering agents and models as composable entities
- **Self-Sovereign Memory**: Each wallet holds its own encrypted memory, usable across any Cinna-compatible agent

## 🧠 What You Can Build

- AI-powered data pipelines that integrate tools like CoinGecko, Firecrawl, and social data sources
- Modular agents that fetch, analyze, and act on real-time information
- Custom intelligent assistants with persistent memory and local data control
- MCP-compatible microservices for AI automation and orchestration

## 🧩 Ecosystem Components

- **Cinna Mesh**: The compositional runtime for connecting and managing AI agents
- **MCP Server**: Deployable endpoints that act as secure gateways between models and tools
- **OSS Registry**: Register and verify your agents, enabling them to interact within the Cinna ecosystem
- **Toolset Layer**: Plug in external APIs or services into your agent flows using a standard interface
